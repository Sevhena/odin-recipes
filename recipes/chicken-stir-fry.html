        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the broccoli and carrots and cook for approximately 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the vegetables from the pan; place them on a plate and cover.

            </li>
            <li>
                Wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and turn the heat to high. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the remaining tablespoon of oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and add them to the pan in a single layer â€“ you may need to do this step in batches. Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the garlic to the pan and cook for 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the vegetables back to the pan and cook for 2 more minutes or until the vegetables are warmed through.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a bowl whisk together the chicken broth, honey and soy sauce. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the soy sauce mixture over the chicken and vegetables; cook for 30 seconds. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the cornstarch and bring to a boil; cook for 1 more minute or until sauce has just started to thicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately, with rice if desired.
            </li>
